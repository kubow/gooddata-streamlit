# GoodData Cloud (native) interaction with streamlit

A demo application to showcase UI for interacting with [GoodData Cloud / CN instances](https://www.gooddata.com/developers/cloud-native/doc/cloud/deploy-and-install/).

## Work process

- Fill endpoint URL
- Insert your [Personal access token](https://www.gooddata.com/developers/cloud-native/doc/cloud/getting-started/create-api-token/)
- Click **Connect** button to get GoodData details
- Select from available [Workspaces](https://www.gooddata.com/developers/cloud-native/doc/cloud/manage-deployment/concepts/workspace/)

## To-Do

- BUG: Confirming values fills the next selector for second try (must be first one)
- TODO: Multiselects choose only one value initially
- TODO: Final buttons ("Build an insight"/"Build up data") are not working for now.
- Finish selector as per [Using callbacks and session state in Streamlit forms Â· GitHub](https://gist.github.com/asehmi/f3c76dae68a877138cf9b7307ddebdf7)

- TODO: Add dependabot to the repository
